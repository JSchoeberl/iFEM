This repository contains an interactive introduction to the Finite Element Method
---

This material is prepared by Joachim Schoeberl and colleagues at TU Wien.

The course consists of jupyter-notebooks teaching the theory of the
finite element method. It uses the Python interface to the NGSolve Finite Element
library to let the readers experiment with the methods just learned.

If you want to try the course out without installing the NGSolve library on your computer you
can launch the material on binder by clicking on the 'launch binder' logo:

The first time launching iFEM may take a few minutes. When it's ready,
you can work through the tutorials pressing "shift-enter". 

This interactive lecture material got possible by the embedded
webgui-visualization developed by M. Hochsteger in home-office.

Note: this material has nothing to do with the excellent matlab finite element package iFEM by Long Chen
