# Riesz representation theorem and symmetric variational problems

Let $u \in V$. Then, we can define the related continuous linear
functional $l_u(\cdot) \in V^\ast$ by

$$
l_u (v) := (u,v)_V \qquad \forall \, v \in V.
$$

The opposite is also true:

<b> Theorem: (Riesz Representation Theorem) </b>

Any continuous linear functional $l(\cdot)$ on a Hilbert space $V$ can be represented uniquely as

$$
l(v) = (u_l,v)_V
$$
for some $u_l \in V$. Furthermore, we have

$$
\| l \|_{V^\ast} = \| u_l \|_V.
$$
